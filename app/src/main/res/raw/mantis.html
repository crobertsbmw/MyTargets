                <p>The formula? Stability + Consistency.</p>
                <p>When performance is measured, performance improves. The Mantis X8 is a data-driven approach to mastery.</p>
                <p>At its core, the X8 is a precision IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer) that analyzes movement patterns. The X8 analyzes thousands of data points per second, sending the data to an app that provides real-time feedback on your shooting performance.</p>
                <p>The Mantis X8 is designed to answer questions that were previously unanswerable: what about that shot was different?  How consistent am I?  My body and mind say one thing, but what actually happened?</p>
                <p>The data does not lie. And now we finally have access to unprecedented data.</p>
                <p>The X8 may change the way you shoot. It certainly will change the way you understand your shooting.</p>
