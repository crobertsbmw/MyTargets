            <h1>INTRODUCING THE ALL-NEW X8!</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>NEVER MISS AGAIN</h2>
                <p>The formula? Stability + Consistency. When performance is measured, performance improves. The Mantis X8 is a data-driven approach to mastery. At its core, the X8 is a precision IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer) that analyzes movement patterns.  The X8 analyzes thousands of data points per second, sending the data to an app that provides real-time feedback on your shooting performance. The Mantis X8 is designed to answer questions that were previously unanswerable: what about that shot was different?  How consistent am I?  My body and mind say one thing, but what actually happened? The data does not lie.  And now we finally have access to unprecedented data. The X8 may change the way you shoot.  It certainly will change the way you understand your shooting.</p>
