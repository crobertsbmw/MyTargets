                <p>
                   So you've been tracking your training with MyTargets for a while now, and you're probably feeling like you're a pretty descent archer and maybe want to take things to the next level? Suddenly you've noticed this new "Train with mantis X8" button.
                   What is the hell is this supposed to be? Imagine if we got a bunch of data geeks and hardware engineers that normally work on UAV stabilization systems to get really into archery...

                <p>The Mantis X8 is a hardware sensor, which attaches to your bow, to give you additional data and insights into your shooting performance.</p>

                <p>At its core, the X8 is a precision sensor that records all of the movements of the shooter before the arrow flies. The X8 analyzes thousands of data points per second, sending the data to the app, and providing real-time feedback on your shooting performance. So now you're able to not only track where the arrows land, but why they landed where they did.</p>

                <p>The Mantis X8 is designed to answer questions that were previously unanswerable: what about that shot was different? How consistent am I? My body and mind say one thing, but what actually happened?</p>

                <p>The X8 may change the way you shoot. It certainly will change the way you understand your shooting.</p>
